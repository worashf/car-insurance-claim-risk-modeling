üìå Guiding Questions

What‚Äôs the overall Loss Ratio (TotalClaims / TotalPremium)? How does it vary?
Are there outliers in TotalClaims or CustomValueEstimate?
Do claim trends vary over time (18-month window)?
Which vehicle makes/models have the highest or lowest claims?

KPIs:

Proactive learning and reference sharing.


Task 2: DVC Setup
Steps:
pip install dvc
dvc init
mkdir /path/to/your/local/storage
dvc remote add -d localstorage /path/to/your/local/storage
dvc add data/your-data-file.csv
git add your-data-file.csv.dvc .gitignore
git commit -m "Track data with DVC"
dvc push

Goal: Version data inputs to ensure reproducibility, traceability, and auditability.
KPIs:

Successful DVC initialization and data tracking.
Data pipeline reproducibility verified.


Task 3: Learn Insurance Terminology
Objective:
Gain proficiency in insurance domain knowledge to ensure accurate application of concepts in data analysis and modeling.
Steps:

Study the 50 Common Insurance Terms.
Focus on terms relevant to the project, such as:
Premium: The amount paid for insurance coverage.
Claim: A request for payment due to loss or damage.
Loss Ratio: The ratio of TotalClaims to TotalPremium, indicating profitability.
Underwriting: The process of evaluating risk to determine premiums.
Deductible: The amount a policyholder pays before insurance covers a claim.


Apply terminology in EDA, modeling, and documentation (e.g., use ‚ÄúLoss Ratio‚Äù correctly in README.md and notebooks).
Create a glossary in the notebooks/ directory (e.g., glossary.md) summarizing key terms and their relevance to the project.

Deliverables:

A documented glossary of at least 10 relevant terms with definitions and examples in the context of the project.
Evidence of terminology usage in EDA reports, code comments, or model documentation.

KPIs:

Accurate use of insurance terminology in project deliverables.
Glossary file committed to the repository.
Demonstrated understanding in analysis and modeling outputs.


Task 4: A/B Hypothesis Testing
Objective:
Evaluate risk and profitability differences across key segments to inform marketing strategies.
Hypotheses to Test:

H1: There are no risk differences across provinces (e.g., claim frequency or severity).
H2: There are no risk differences across zip codes (e.g., TotalClaims distribution).
H3: There are no significant profit margin differences across zip codes (e.g., TotalPremium - TotalClaims).
H4: There are no significant gender-based risk differences (e.g., claim probability by gender).

Steps:

Data Preparation: Use preprocessed data from Task 1.2 (EDA) with features like Province, ZipCode, Gender, TotalClaims, and TotalPremium.
Statistical Tests:
Use t-tests or ANOVA for continuous variables (e.g., TotalClaims across provinces).
Use chi-square tests for categorical variables (e.g., claim occurrence by gender).
Apply Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons to control Type I errors.


Visualizations: Create box plots, bar charts, or heatmaps to visualize differences (e.g., LossRatio by province).
Interpretation: Accept or reject null hypotheses based on p-values (threshold: 0.05) and document findings in a notebook (e.g., notebooks/hypothesis_testing.ipynb).

Deliverables:

A Jupyter notebook summarizing test results, including:
Test statistics, p-values, and conclusions for each hypothesis.
Visualizations (e.g., box plots for TotalClaims by province).


Key findings integrated into the marketing strategy (e.g., target low-risk provinces).

KPIs:

Correct application of statistical tests.
Clear visualizations and interpretations.
Actionable insights for marketing (e.g., low-risk segments identified).


Task 5: Build and Evaluate Predictive Models for Dynamic Risk-Based Pricing
Objective:
Develop and evaluate predictive models to form the core of a dynamic, risk-based pricing system for car insurance, enabling accurate claim severity prediction, claim probability estimation, and premium optimization.
Modeling Goals:

Claim Severity Prediction (Risk Model):
Build a regression model to predict TotalClaims for policies with claims (where TotalClaims > 0).
Target Variable: TotalClaims (on the subset of data where claims > 0).
Evaluation Metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to penalize large prediction errors, and R-squared to measure explained variance.


Claim Probability Prediction:
Build a binary classification model to predict the probability of a claim occurring (HasClaim: 1 if TotalClaims > 0, else 0).
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC (with focus on handling class imbalance).


Premium Optimization (Pricing Framework):
Develop a model to predict optimal premiums, combining predicted claim probability and severity.
Formula: Premium = (Predicted Probability of Claim * Predicted Claim Severity) + Expense Loading + Profit Margin.
Move beyond naive prediction of CalculatedPremiumPerTerm to a business-driven approach incorporating risk and cost factors.



Tasks:

Data Preparation:
Handling Missing Data: Impute missing values (e.g., median for numeric, mode for categorical) or remove rows/columns based on missingness extent.
Feature Engineering: Create features like VehicleAge (from RegistrationYear), LossRatio (TotalClaims / TotalPremium), or risk indicators (e.g., high-value vehicle flags).
Encoding Categorical Data: Use one-hot encoding for categorical features (e.g., Gender, Province, VehicleType) or label encoding where appropriate.
Train-Test Split: Split data into 80:20 or 70:30 train-test sets, ensuring stratification for classification tasks.


Modeling Techniques:
Linear Regression: Baseline model for claim severity prediction.
Decision Trees: Simple tree-based model for both regression and classification.
Random Forests: Ensemble model for improved performance and robustness.
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs):
XGBoost: High-performance model for both severity (regression) and probability (classification), with support for class imbalance handling (e.g., scale_pos_weight).




Implementation:
Use a class like DynamicRiskPricing (in scripts/dynamic_risk_pricing.py) to encapsulate preprocessing, modeling, and premium calculation.
Train separate models for severity (TotalClaims) and probability (HasClaim).
Combine outputs for premium optimization using the formula above, with configurable Expense Loading (e.g., 10%) and Profit Margin (e.g., 15%).


Evaluation:
For severity: Compute RMSE and R-squared on the test set.
For probability: Compute accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC AUC, addressing class imbalance (e.g., using scale_pos_weight or SMOTE).
For premiums: Validate predicted premiums against business constraints (e.g., profitability, competitiveness).



Deliverables:

A Jupyter notebook (e.g., notebooks/modeling.ipynb) documenting:
Data preparation steps.
Model training and evaluation for severity and probability.
Premium optimization results with sample predictions.


A Python script (e.g., scripts/dynamic_risk_pricing.py) implementing the DynamicRiskPricing class.
Visualizations (e.g., feature importance plots, confusion matrices, premium distributions).

KPIs:

Model performance: RMSE < [threshold], R-squared > 0.7 for severity; F1 > 0.5, ROC AUC > 0.8 for probability.
Identification of low-risk customer segments for marketing.
Reproducible pipeline with DVC-tracked data and models.
Actionable premium predictions aligned with business goals (e.g., profitability).
